# TicTacToe
## A small JS project by Ian.

Hello Everyone! This is Ian, and this Tic-Tac-Toe project is part of me completing the Odin Project Course.
This is part of he Javascript OOP section where I get some grasps about objects and how to use them. This 
project is incomplete and I'm still learning the minimax algorithm and how to implement it to my code in order
to have that unbeatable feature. Thank you and enjoy playing against yourself, or another human being, or the
dumb "ai" that I implemented for easy mode!
